# Super simple go web server
This example is taken from [Learn Go Programming by Building 11 projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfo23yIWac&t=142s).

## Overview
- This web server serves up a site that displays a few things
- There is also a form where user input is submitted
- The user input is displayed as log messages

## Notes
- I added a .gitignore to prevent exe files from clogging up my repo
- It took a while to configure the go module. I don't think it's necessary to go over this if you are following the video, but of course I configured things my own way. A bit of RTFM from [go mod init](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-init) did the trick
