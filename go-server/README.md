# Super simple go web server
This example is taken from [Learn Go Programming by Building 11 projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfo23yIWac&t=142s).

## Overview
- This web server serves up a site that displays a few things
- There is also a form where user input is submitted
- The user input is displayed as log messages

## Notes
- I added a .gitignore to prevent exe files from clogging up my repo
